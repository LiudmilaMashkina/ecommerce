## Feedback

* What went well?
  * Working on the same file and merging conflicts was really not that bad.
  * Creating Products page was easier to make than expected because we shared OOP classes between both pages.
  * We communicated well and managed to split out the workload so that everyone felt comfortable.
* What did not go well?
  * Nav bar took longer than expected
  * Combining sort+filter was a challenge
* What would you do the same for the next project?
  * Go lemurs. We would work again together!
  * Use OOP principles
  * Merge conflicts together and work through pull requests.
  * Make decisions together
* What would you do differently for the next project?
  * Separate out the data and keep it in a database / file instead
  * Plan out the architecture of the product more precisely
  * Spend more time on the UI
